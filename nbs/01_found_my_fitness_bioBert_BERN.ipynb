      "28:: That's hilarious. My alcoholic triathlete brother in law didn't get this memo. He ran 7 minute miles at 57 and was a massive alcoholic. He did his last iron man at 62. My addict late husband exercised all day long, surfed (a sport which is fraught with addiction and majorly challenging) and lifted weights. Tell the Marines who line the AA meetings in Quantico. I got kicked out of a full contact karate studio where I worked out every night like crazy, for maintenance drinking. This just shows you still don't understand. Read the doctor's opinion in the big book. He worked with drunks - alcoholism is different from drug addiction - for 40 years. Some biopsycho phenomenon occurs when two people work together. #36yearssober ::\n",

I have waded through some of your longer format videos with guests but I must admit I've rarely watched them all the way through. The impression I got from those was they were more than likely aimed at medical professionals. In this new format, the information flow is clear, salient points delineated and I like the \"Science Proof\" (as opposed to \"Social Proof\") of the study documentation being shown at left, as discussed. I appreciate the information that you share Dr. Patrick! ::\n",

It alone does not treat the disease but it is very helpful as an adjunct. Swapping addictions does not address the underlying psycho-emotional reasons for the addiction; all the same, a healthy one is preferred to a destructive one. \n",
